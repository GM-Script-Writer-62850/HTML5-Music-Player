This is a basic HTML5 music player
This was made to have the basic features in a music player as well as have a mobile friendly layout

Setup:
1. Add the index.html, player,js, player,css, and playlist.php files to a folder on your web server
2. Create a folder called library in that folder, this folder should contain your music
this folder can be a symlink to your main music folder

Any files/folders starting with a "." will be ignored
Cover images should be named cover (not case sensitive), they should be in png, jpg/jpeg, or gif format, basically anything a web browser can display
Cover images are optional
Any file not called cover will be treated as a audio file
All files should have a file extension (eg .png, .mp3, .ogg, etc)
This uses 3 icons from the apache web server, if you are using a different web service, grab these icons and save them as the following:
<a href="http://www.apache.org/icons/open.folder.png" target="_blank">/icons/open.folder.png</a>
<a href="http://www.apache.org/icons/folder.png" target="_blank">/icons/folder.png</a>
<a href="http://www.apache.org/icons/sound2.png" target="_blank">/icons/sound2.png</a>
