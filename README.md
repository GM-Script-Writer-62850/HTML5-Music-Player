This is a basic HTML5 music player<br/>
This was made to have the basic features in a music player as well as have a mobile friendly layout<br/>

Setup:<br/>
1. Add the index.html, player,js, player,css, and playlist.php files to a folder on your web server<br/>
2. Create a folder called library in that folder, this folder should contain your music<br/>
this folder can be a symlink to your main music folder<br/>

Any files/folders starting with a "." will be ignored<br/>
Cover images should be named cover (not case sensitive), they should be in png, jpg/jpeg, or gif format, basically anything a web browser can display<br/>
Cover images are optional<br/>
Any file not called cover will be treated as a audio file<br/>
All files should have a file extension (eg .png, .mp3, .ogg, etc)<br/>
This uses 3 icons from the apache web server, if you are using a different web service, grab these icons and save them as the following:<br/>
<a href="http://www.apache.org/icons/open.folder.png" target="_blank">/icons/open.folder.png</a><br/>
<a href="http://www.apache.org/icons/folder.png" target="_blank">/icons/folder.png</a><br/>
<a href="http://www.apache.org/icons/sound2.png" target="_blank">/icons/sound2.png</a>
